2. add automatically load countryloadpol  ==> line   if (is.null(countries.shapefile)) in F_workflow
3. implement BIEN method(e.g. Maitner method) in centroidDetection
2. verbose the workflow
3. shrink the code (particularly make the .status.tracker function to work in 1 line)
4. add warning if country code is in two letters instead of three (potentially make that bypass internal)

6. function that filters by test
