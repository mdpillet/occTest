Title: Characterizing Species Occurrence Data Quality
Version: 0.1
Author: Pep Serra Diaz, Cory Merow, Brian Maitner
Maintainer: Cory Merow <cory.merow@gmail.com>
Description: Tools for determining the quality of occurrence data and optionally cleaning them. Profiling is based on (1) missing data and geographical errors; (2) Filtering duplicate records; (3) Sea/Terrestrial potential reassignment; (4) Country-related range analysis; (5) Geoenvironmental analysis. Based on the outcomes of these tests, each records is assigned a grade. Users can then optionally filter based on grades.
