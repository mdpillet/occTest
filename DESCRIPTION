Version: 0.1
Author: JM Serra Diaz, Cory Merow, Brian Maitner, Jeremy Borderieux

Description: Tools for determining potential errors of occurrence data and filter them. Multiple tests are performed and grouped based on (1) missing data and geographical errors; (2) Filtering duplicate records; (3) Sea/Terrestrial potential reassignment; (4) Country-related range analysis; (5) Geographic and (6) environmental analysis. Based on the outcomes of these tests several scores are summarized to let the user decide which occurrences to filter.
