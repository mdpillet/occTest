**occTest is currently under review and has been recently adapted to sf and terra packages. It will soon be submitted to CRAN once final checks are realized**

A workflow for general testing of species occurrence records in geographical, environmental and temporal scale. The workflow is structured through set of algorithms to identify potential problems with species occurrence records by employing a hierarchical organization of multiple tests. 

The workflow has a hierarchical structure organized in testPhases (i.e. cleaning vs. testing), that encompass different testBlocks grouping different testTypes (e.g. environmental outlier detection) which may use different testMethods (e.g. Rosner test, jacknife,etc.). Four different testBlocks characterize potential problems in geographic, environmental, human influence, and temporal dimensions.  Filtering and plotting functions are incorporated to facilitate the interpretation of tests. 


# Installation
## Stable from CRAN
Under review

## Developmental from GitHub
```r
devtools::install_github("pepbioalerts/occTest")
library(occTest)
```

# Usage
Simple example of a workflow below. A full explained vignette can be found at github.com/pepbioalerts/occtest. This second repo also serves as a data repo for automatic datasets used but occTest, such as human influence index or county centroids, when the user decides to use certain tests.

```r

#load environmental SpatRast

library (occTest)
#load occurrence data
occData <- read.csv (system.file('ext/exampleOccData.csv',package = 'occTest'))
#load environmental SpatRast

#load settings
settings <- readRDS (system.file('ext/exSettings.rds',package = 'occTest'))
#run occTest
out = occTest(sp.name='MyFake species',
              sp.table = occData,ntv.ctry = 'ESP',inv.ctry = 'FRA',
              tableSettings = settings$tableSettings,
              writeoutSettings = settings$writeoutSettings,
              analysisSettings = settings$analysisSettings,
              r.env = renv,r.dem=dem)
